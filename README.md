To get started `make help`

If you do not have make installed. `sh scripts/brew.sh`

Fonts - You gotta change the default font in every terminal app after you install `font-hack-nerd-font` through brew.

### TODO

- Add env into your shell. Figure out how to represent machines you ssh onto (QA, qa2 etc...)
- Move common functions like `gitco` to their own file. Maybe just get rid of bad scripts for now?
- Starship transient prompts
- Github scripts.
  - List PRs from people who are on my team
  - List PRs I am tagged as a reviewer
  - When someone reviews my PR
  - Comments I have not responded to
  - Create a PR
  - My open/all PRs and their status
  - ...
- Get some temux stuff going
- Set up some custom monitoring scripts using `htop`, `duf`, or `bpytop`
